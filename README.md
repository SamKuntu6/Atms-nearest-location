# Atms-nearest-location

written in Python and the nearest location is found by assuming the direct line of sight based in longitudes and latitudes differences to get the hypotenus and thus nearest distance.

The actual distance if it where taken from google API would have a lot more factors to consider other than distance alone example the altitude of the user, real time trafic on the road, roads difficulties..etc
